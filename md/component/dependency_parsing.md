# Dependency Parsing

Our dependency parser uses a transition-based, non-projective parsing algorithm coupled with bootstrapping. It shows a linear-time speed for both projective and non-projective parsing, processing about 15K tokens per second on an Intel Xeon 2.30GHz machine, and shows state-of-the-art accuracy for greedy parsing.
